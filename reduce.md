# What is reduce() in Python?

In Python, the reduce() function is used to apply a particular function passed in its arguments to all of the elements of an iterable.

Here's the basic syntax:

```python
from functools import reduce

result = reduce(function, iterable, initial)
```

- function: This is the function that you want to apply cumulatively to the items of the iterable. It takes two arguments: an accumulator and the current value.
- iterable: This is the iterable sequence of items that you want to apply the function to.
- initial (optional): This is an optional argument. If provided, it will be placed before the items of the iterable in the calculation and serve as a default when the iterable is empty.

Here is a example about how to use the function:

```python
from functools import reduce

# Function to add two numbers
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

# Using reduce to find the sum of a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sum_result = reduce(add, numbers)
print(sum_result)  # Output: 15
```
